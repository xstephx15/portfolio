    <h8 style="font-size:190;"> I cut off about 12 inches or more to donate it to children with cancer and I'm loving my short hair. At first I had some doubts in cutting my hair because I'v enever really cut my hair that short and I was use to having my hair really long but I was doing it for a good cause. </h8>
